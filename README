1. INSTALLING AND UPDATING
--------------------------

	You can find the latest version of this program at:

		http://www.hpgs.cjb.net

	Extract the compressed file in a directory and go to the hpgs direc-
	tory:

		$tar xvzf hpgs-X.XX
		$cd hpgs-X.XX

		(X.XX is the version)

	Before installing,  check if the GhostScript is in the  ``/usr/bin''
	directory:

		$which gs
		/usr/bin/gs

	If it is in another directory, modify the hpgs.c and Makefile files,
	adding the correct directory.

	After, type:

		$make

	This will make the hpgs binary.

	***********************************
	** PLEASE NOTE!!! PLEASE NOTE!!! **
	***********************************

	hpgs needs to be installed as ``gs''. The original  ``gs''  needs to
	be named as ``gs-run'', both in the ``/usr/bin'' directory.

	If this is the first time you instal hpgs, type, as root:

		#make really-install

	If you have an old version of hpgs,  you might have a ``gs.default''
	file in ``/usr/bin''. This is your GhostScript ``gs''. You will need
	to remove the  ``/usr/bin/gs''  file and  rename the  ``gs.default''
	to ``gs'' before installing. Another way is to type, as root:

		#make update

	I  used  really-instal instead  just install because  if someone who
	wants to _update_ the system runs the _install_ script, he/she  will
	not be able to run the hpgs because the old hpgs will  be renamed to
	``gs-run'' and the  new hpgs  will  call the  old hpgs  instead  the
	``gs'' command.


2. USING
--------

	In the printtool,  install you printer using the  ``HP DeskJet 550C/
	560C/6xxC series'' filter (driver).

	To enable the EconoMode printing,  set the  ``Extra GS Options''  to
	``-dDepletion=-1''. (You  can  set the print quality  by  seting the
	-dDepletion to another value).

	You can do something like this  with  linuxconf,  but it will not be
	described here.
